					<h2>Aim AI11</h2>
					<p>Shaping the Future of AI Development.</p>

					<h2>Сore product - PogrAI</h2>
					<p>Our core product PogrAI is a platform that enables teams and individual developers to easily create AI-powered games and educational applications.</p>

					<h2>The Problem and the Solution</h2>
					<p>Game and app development is an exciting but complex process that requires technical skills, time, and significant resources. Many developers face barriers that limit their potential. But what if there was a solution that made game and app creation easier and accessible to everyone? This is exactly what PogrAI offers.</p>
					<div class="features">
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
							<h3>Programming Complexity</h3>
							<p>Creating games requires knowledge of programming languages, frameworks and game engines. A powerful <strong>AI</strong> will create the entire UI, game world, characters, game mechanics, and all game logic for you, <strong>allowing you to focus on creativity rather than technical aspects.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
							<h3>Creativity Limitations</h3>
							<p>Technical difficulties force developers to simplify their ideas and restrict possibilities. <strong>A flexible game creation system gives developers full creative freedom.</strong> A vast collection of templates and built-in assets not only removes limitations but also inspires and fuels creativity.</p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-mobile-alt"></span>
							<h3>Multi-Platform Support</h3>
							<p>Developing a game for multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, web) requires significant effort and time. Since our application is available on all these platforms, <strong>games and applications created within it are automatically supported across all of them without extra work.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-calendar"></span>
							<h3>Long Development Cycles</h3>
							<p>Developing a game can take months or even years, requiring significant effort and resources. <strong>A powerful AI, along with a vast collection of templates and assets, drastically reduces development time.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-coins"></span>
							<h3>High Resources Costs</h3>
							<p>High-quality graphics, animations, sounds, and other assets require significant investment. <strong>Extensive asset libraries and built-in resources generation tools reduce costs and accelerate the process.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-robot"></span>
							<h3>AI Integration Challenges</h3>
							<p>Implementing AI in games requires specialized knowledge and experience. <strong>Simple AI integration through the platform makes it accessible even without deep expertise.</strong></p>
						</section>
					</div>

					<p>PogrAI removes the barriers that hinder game development, allowing anyone to bring their ideas to life without complexity or high costs. The future of game creation is accessible and innovative — and it starts here.</p>

					<h2>PogrAI</h2>
					<p>PogrAI is an innovative platform that simplifies the entire game and app creation process. Using a unified declarative model, developers can leverage any modern AI model to generate and validate their projects effortlessly. The platform supports mobile, desktop, and web, with AI-driven localization for a global audience. A built-in marketplace allows instant publishing and access to resources like graphics, animations, and sounds. AI is deeply integrated, enabling intelligent characters, interactive experiences, and multiplayer functionality. High-quality vector graphics ensure stunning visuals on any screen. With PogrAI, development becomes faster, easier, and more accessible than ever.</p>
				</div>
				<section>
					<div class="content">
						<div class="inner">
							<h2>From Idea to Implementation</h2>
							<p>A unified, standardized, declarative model for describing a game or application makes it easy to use any modern large language model (LLM) for generation. This provides greater freedom in choosing between open-source or commercial LLMs. The built-in engine allows you to both run the game or application and validate the correctness of the generated app model. A vast collection of games and applications templates, along with ready-made prompts, makes implementation effortless - eliminating the need to start from scratch and ensuring that you can seamlessly request changes from the LLM without worrying about formulation.</p>

							<h2>Multi-platform and localization</h2>
							<p>We strive to make PogrAI accessible to as many people as possible. That’s why our application supports major mobile and desktop platforms, as well as the web. This means you can create and play games anywhere, on any device. For developers, this is a huge advantage, as their games or apps can reach the widest possible audience. And with the power of AI, we provide accurate localization into multiple languages, opening the door to the global market.</p>

							<h2>Marketplace</h2>
							<p>With PogrAI, publishing your game or application becomes as simple as possible — just one click, and it's available to the entire community. Our shared marketplace, with a classification and rating system, helps users easily find exciting projects. Additionally, the marketplace offers a variety of resources for game and app creation, including graphics, animations, sounds, music, and much more. This not only simplifies the development process but also fosters collaboration within the community.</p>

							<h2>AI Inside</h2>
							<p>In PogrAI, AI plays a key role not only in creating games and applications but also within them. Imagine interacting with AI-driven characters who act as opponents, companions, assistants, or teachers. This unlocks endless possibilities for diversity and depth in both gameplay and educational experiences. Additionally, we support a multiplayer mode, enabling interaction with friends or other users worldwide. This enhances the social aspect, making games and learning even more engaging.</p>

							<h2>High quality graphics</h2>
							<p>Support for vector graphics and animation ensures that images always remain crisp and beautiful, regardless of resolution or screen size. At the same time, vector formats take up less space compared to raster images. To achieve this, we use SVG and Lottie formats, which are supported in Flutter. This allows developers to easily integrate high-quality graphics and animations into their games and applications.</p>
