					<p>Creating technologies to develop the best in us.</p>

					<h3>Сore product - PogrAI</h3>
					<p>Our core product PogrAI is a platform that enables teams and individual developers to easily create AI-powered games and educational applications.</p>

					<h3>The Problem and the Solution</h3>
					<p>Game and app development is an exciting but complex process that requires technical skills, time, and significant resources. Many developers face barriers that limit their potential. But what if there was a solution that made game and app creation easier and accessible to everyone? This is exactly what PogrAI offers.</p>
					<div class="features">
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
							<h3>Programming Complexity</h3>
							<p>Creating games requires knowledge of programming languages, frameworks and game engines. A powerful <strong>AI</strong> will create the entire UI, game world, characters, game mechanics, and all game logic for you, <strong>allowing you to focus on creativity rather than technical aspects.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
							<h3>Creativity Limitations</h3>

						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-calendar"></span>
							<h3>Long Development Cycles</h3>
							<p>Developing a game can take months or even years, requiring significant effort and resources. <strong>A powerful AI, along with a vast collection of templates and assets, drastically reduces development time.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-coins"></span>
							<h3>High Resources Costs</h3>
							<p>High-quality graphics, animations, sounds, and other assets require significant investment. <strong>Extensive asset libraries and built-in resources generation tools reduce costs and accelerate the process.</strong></p>
						</section>
						<section>
							<span class="icon solid major fa-robot"></span>
							<h3>AI Integration Challenges</h3>
							<p>Implementing AI in games requires specialized knowledge and experience. <strong>Simple AI integration through the platform makes it accessible even without deep expertise.</strong></p>

							<h3>From Idea to Implementation</h3>
							<p>A unified, standardized, declarative model for describing a game or application makes it easy to use any modern large language model (LLM) for generation. This provides greater freedom in choosing between open-source or commercial LLMs. The built-in engine allows you to both run the game or application and validate the correctness of the generated app model. A vast collection of games and applications templates, along with ready-made prompts, makes implementation effortless - eliminating the need to start from scratch and ensuring that you can seamlessly request changes from the LLM without worrying about formulation.</p>
